# _Dispatching Software_

#### _This will be my capstone project for the coursework I did at Epicodus_

#### By _**Philip Eskins**_

## Description

_This project will imitate dispatching software that I've used in the past when I used to work for HVAC companies. This will be an ongoing effort so please check the Process for future updates._

## Current Features
* No features at this time, still in planning stage.

## MVP Features
* Basic functionality will be to just have a site that connects to Firebase and allows you to create, read, update, and delete the following: customers, work orders, addresses, technicians.
* Include the ability to assign jobs to each technician and to rearrange/reassign as needed.

## Future features
_Features that would make this an awesome dispatching software._
* Implameting seperate logins for dispatcher, technicians, supervisor/admin, and customer.
* Integrate google maps api to provide distance from one job to the next on the technicians schedule.
* Allow customers to login and create new work orders for there business/house/or additional properties they own.
* Start/Stop function for the work orders.
* Alert system that will check in with the tech 15 mintues prior to the estimated completed time has passed to make sure they are running on schedule.
* Inventory system for technicians vans (which would update if they specificed they used a part on a job)
* Alerts sent to dispatcher/technician if critical inventory is getting low or has run out.
* Suggested schedule for technicians (based on distance from home/previous job, technicians senority, technicians skills, and skills needed for the job)
* Parts under warranty listed on the unit page.
* Work orders still under warranty have an extra notification.
* Easier quote generator for needed/recommended repairs.
* Automatic alert to dispatch if customer approves quote and wants the tech to do it same day or to schedule for a future date.
* Automatic work order created when new quote is submitted and alert is sent to the office if approved.
* If customer signs up for a maintenance plan then the maintenance work order will automatically generate and send an email reminder to the customer to call and get it scheduled at the specificed interval when the agreement was made and have an alert in the office that the maintenance is due.
* If a recall or alert goes out for a unit be able to effectivly search for those units and flag them.
* Implamete VoIP calling features, so techs or office workers can click on a number to dial it.
* Centralized area to check what parts are pending for work orders, that way its easy to see if something is due today and if doesn't arrive its easy to catch.
* Additional features as I think of them.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Download repository from https://github.com/PhilipEskins/dispatch/_
* _Type npm install in the dispatch directory in the terminal_
* _Type npm run start and the website will open up in a new browser window_
* _If you'd like to alter or see the code for the project, after downloading open the folder up in your favorite code editor._

## Process

#### Friday 5/3/2019
_Since this mostly a planning day the format for this entry will be a little different. I need to account for the time spent hour by hour so my instructors will know what I've been working on._
* 8:00am to 9:00am - Was reading <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html">Think in React</a> and making README
* 9:00am to 10:00am - Collaborated with a former coworker (who is still doing dispatching at my old company) on some future features that would make this project really awesome if I'm able to figure out how to implament them.
* 10:00am to 11:00am - Small mental break after thinking up future features. Started working on User Stories.
* 11:00am to 12:00pm - Continue working on User Stories.
* 1200pm to 1:00pm - Lunch.
* 1:00pm to 2:00pm - Finish user stories and start planning data structure.
* 2:00pm to 3:00pm - Finish planning data structure, might change after I think about it some more.
* 3:00pm to 4:00pm - Thought up a new future feature and adjusted Work Order data. Started contemplating layout. Brain is getting tired from thinking about this project so much. Will need to take a mental health break. Will put in more time either later today or over the weekend.
